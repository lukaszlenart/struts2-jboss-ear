# Struts2 JBoss EAR example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszlenart/struts2-jboss-ear.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszlenart/struts2-jboss-ear)

Simple demo how to create JBoss based ear application with Struts 2 and Convention plugin - was tested with JBoss 5 and 7

It specify acctions in two places:
- struts2-ear-ejb module
- struts2-ear-jar module

but such configuration will not work as you must include struts2-core in struts2-ear-web module to allow access to struts-tags.tld

If your actions don't have a presentation layer which base on JSP tags, thus will work. In other case you must specify your actions in struts2-ear-web module or extract struts-tags.tld into WEB-INF

Update 2013-06-12

I have added the Struts 2 CDI plugin with simple test case to show how to use CDI with JUnit - check IndexTest
